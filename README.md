A zipping library based on [yazl](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/yazl). This library provides a better API and state management, while using the same low-level dserialization logic.

**Warning:** This library is not considered stable until version 1.0.0. The API and the internals can completely or partically change for any or no reason. It also doesn't have a significant amount automated tests and documentation.

The library might later be merged with [@arbendium/yauzl](https://github.com/arbendium/yauzl) to provide efficient support for modifying ZIP files.
